# Brew Master Pro 2.0

This is the UI Component to the Brew Server.  This client controls the workflow through a Home brew from recipe all the way through the boil and fermentation.  

Here is an admittedly bad screen shot of fermentation in progress:

### How to run in a VS Code dev container:
---
- When opening in VS Code, it should detect that this has a dev container and give the option to 'Open in Container'
- Alternatively you can open 'Remote Explorer' on the left side and then click '+' - Open folder in container

Once inside the dev container run terminal and then run
>`yarn start`
